## Introduction

Azure Local is a hyperconverged infrastructure (HCI) solution that combines software-defined compute, storage, and networking on industry-standard servers. Deploying Azure Local on Cisco UCS servers provides a robust, scalable, and high-performance platform for running virtualized workloads and hybrid cloud services.

This guide walks you through the deployment process, highlighting key steps and considerations specific to Cisco UCS hardware.

---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

**Cisco UCS Hardware:**

- Cisco UCS C-Series servers (e.g., M7 C220 or C240) compatible with Azure Local.
- Latest firmware and BIOS updates applied.

**Networking Equipment:**

- Compatible network switches and adapters.

**Software:**

- Windows Server 2022 Datacenter edition or Azure Local, version 23H2 installation media.

**Licenses:**

- Valid licenses for Windows Server or Azure Local.

**Administrative Access:**

- Access to Cisco Integrated Management Controller (CIMC) for each server.
- Access to network infrastructure for configuration.

**Internet Connectivity:**

- Required for downloading updates and registering the cluster with Azure.

---

## Architecture Overview

The deployment consists of the following components:

- **Compute and Storage**: Cisco UCS servers running Azure Local, providing virtualized compute and storage resources.
- **Networking**: High-speed network connectivity using Ethernet adapters and switches for storage replication, virtual machine traffic, and management.
- **Management**: Windows Admin Center for managing the cluster and workloads.
- **Hybrid Services**: Integration with Azure for hybrid capabilities like Azure Monitor, Azure Backup, and more.

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Plan and Prepare

**a. Review Deployment Guides**

- **Microsoft Deployment Introduction:**
  - [Azure Local Deployment Introduction](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure-stack/hci/deploy/deployment-introduction)
- **Cisco Deployment Guide:**
  - [Cisco Azure Local Deployment Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/unified_computing/ucs/UCS_CVDs/ucs_mas_hci_23H2.html)

**b. Verify Hardware Compatibility**

- Ensure your Cisco UCS servers are listed in the [Azure Local Catalog](https://azurestackhcisolutions.azure.microsoft.com/#/catalog?Search=cisco).

**c. Gather Requirements**

- **Network Configuration:**
  - IP addresses for management, storage, and VM networks.
- **Domain Information:**
  - Active Directory domain details for joining servers to the domain.

**d. Firmware and Driver Updates**

- Update firmware and drivers using the [Cisco Host Upgrade Utility (HUU)](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/servers-unified-computing/ucs-c-series-rack-servers/products-release-notes-list.html).

---

### 2. Install Windows Server on Cisco UCS

**a. Access CIMC**

- Log in to the Cisco Integrated Management Controller for each server.

**b. Mount Installation Media**

- Mount the Windows Server or Azure Local ISO using virtual media in CIMC.

**c. Install the Operating System**

- Boot from the mounted ISO and follow the installation prompts.
- Choose **Windows Server 2022 Datacenter** or **Azure Local** as the edition.
- Partition disks as needed.

**d. Configure Initial Settings**

- Set a strong administrator password.
- Configure the server's hostname.

---

### 3. Configure Networking

**a. Install Network Adapters**

- Ensure that all required network adapters are installed and recognized by the operating system.

**b. Install Latest Network Drivers**

- Download and install the latest network drivers from Cisco's support site.

**c. Configure Network Interfaces**

- Assign IP addresses to management interfaces.
- Disable any unused adapters.

**d. Set Up Network Teaming or SET**

- Use Switch Embedded Teaming (SET) or NIC Teaming for redundancy and bandwidth aggregation.

### 4. Install Azure Local

#### a. Download the Azure Local Software

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) with your Azure account.
2. In the search bar, enter **Azure Local** and select it under the **Services** category.
3. On the **Get started** page, under the **Download software** tile, select **Download Azure Local**.
4. Choose **Azure Local, version 23H2** and **English** as the language. 
   - Note: **English** is currently the only supported language for Azure Local.
5. Review the terms and click **Download Azure Local** to start downloading the ISO file.

#### b. Install the Azure Local Operating System

1. Mount the downloaded ISO on each server.
2. Boot from the ISO and follow the installation prompts.
   - Select **Custom: Install the newer version of Azure Local only (advanced)**. Note that upgrade installations are not supported.
3. Set the local administrator password to meet Azure complexity requirements (at least 12 characters with mixed case, numeral, and special character).
4. Configure network settings and drivers using the **SConfig** tool. 

#### c. Configure the Operating System using SConfig

- **Important**: Avoid using SConfig for Windows Updates to prevent deployment failures.
- Use SConfig to set up VLAN IDs, DHCP, and DNS settings as required.
- For valid time synchronization, configure an NTP server using:
  ```powershell
  w32tm /config /manualpeerlist:"ntpserver.contoso.com" /syncfromflags:manual /update
  ```

---

### 5. Create the Cluster

**a. Install Required Roles and Features**

- Open PowerShell as an administrator and run:
  ```powershell
  Install-WindowsFeature -Name Failover-Clustering, RSAT-Clustering-PowerShell, Data-Center-Bridging
  ```

**b. Validate the Cluster Configuration**

- Run the cluster validation wizard:
  ```powershell
  Test-Cluster -Node Server1, Server2 -Include "Storage Spaces Direct", "Inventory", "Network", "System Configuration"
  ```

**c. Create the Cluster**

- Use PowerShell to set up the cluster:
  ```powershell
  New-Cluster -Name ClusterName -Node Server1, Server2 -StaticAddress ClusterIP
  ```

**d. Enable Storage Spaces Direct**

- Enable Storage Spaces Direct on the cluster:
  ```powershell
  Enable-ClusterStorageSpacesDirect
  ```

---

### 6. Validate and Register the Cluster

**a. Register the Cluster with Azure Arc**

1. Register required resource providers in the Azure portal:
   - **Microsoft.HybridCompute**
   - **Microsoft.GuestConfiguration**
   - **Microsoft.HybridConnectivity**
   - **Microsoft.AzureStackHCI**
2. On each server, install required PowerShell modules and run the registration script to register with Azure Arc.

3. Verify that the servers are registered with Arc in the Azure portal.

**b. Set Azure Role Permissions**

- Assign the following permissions for deployment:
  - Azure Local Administrator
  - Reader
  - Key Vault Data Access Administrator
  - Key Vault Secrets Officer
  - Key Vault Contributor
  - Storage Account Contributor
  - Cloud Application Administrator

---

## Post-Deployment Configuration
