# Coding Standards

To ensure consistency and readability throughout the codebase, please follow these coding standards when contributing to the project.

## General Guidelines

- **Code Readability**: Write code that is easy to understand and maintain. Aim for clarity over cleverness.
- **Documentation**: Document all classes, functions, and complex code sections with comments explaining their purpose and functionality.
- **Naming Conventions**: Use descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes. Avoid abbreviations that aren’t universally understood.
- **Code Structure**: Organize code logically into modules or files to promote reusability and maintainability.

## Language-Specific Guidelines

###  Python

- **Style Guide**: Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/), the Python style guide.
- **Naming Conventions**:
  - Use `snake_case` for variable and function names.
  - Use `PascalCase` for class names.
  - Use UPPER_CASE for constants.
- **Indentation**: Use 4 spaces for indentation.
- **Line Length**: Limit each line to a maximum of 79 characters.
- **Docstrings**: Use triple quotes for function and class documentation. Write in a way that helps future developers understand the code’s purpose.
 
## Code Comments

- **Purpose**: Use comments to explain why something is done, not what is done (the code should already be clear on what).
- **Function Comments**: At the beginning of each function, add a comment describing its purpose, inputs, and outputs.
- **Complex Logic**: For complex or non-obvious code, add inline comments to explain the reasoning.

Example of a function comment in Python:
```python
def calculate_total(price, tax_rate):
    """
    Calculate the total price after applying tax.

    Args:
        price (float): The initial price of the item.
        tax_rate (float): The tax rate to apply.

    Returns:
        float: The total price after tax.
    """
    return price * (1 + tax_rate)
```

## Version Control Guidelines

- **Commit Messages**:
  - Use concise and descriptive messages.
  - Use the present tense (e.g., “Add feature” instead of “Added feature”).
  - Prefix the commit message with the type of change (e.g., `fix:`, `feat:`, `docs:`).

## Testing

- **Test Coverage**: Ensure new features and bug fixes are covered by unit tests.
- **Testing Frameworks**: Use [Specify testing framework, e.g., Pytest for Python, Jest for JavaScript].
- **Naming Tests**: Test names should clearly indicate the functionality being tested.

By following these coding standards, we ensure a high-quality codebase that is easier to understand, maintain, and scale. Thank you for contributing to the consistency and reliability of the project!
