# Robust Intelligence

Robust Intelligence. A solution for maintaining AI integrity by identifying and mitigating risks inherent to production AI. This platform integrates into the AI pipeline to ensure continuous oversight of security, ethical, and operational risks.

## What is AI Risk?

AI risk refers to the potential negative consequences of deploying AI models in production, including security, ethical, and operational risks:

- **Security Risks**: Vulnerabilities that expose models to adversarial actors, leading to possible exploitation, data leakage, model evasion, theft, and system breaches.
- **Ethical Risks**: Violations of norms, laws, or governance standards, often involving bias, fairness, or offensive language. These risks can result in reputational damage, inequality, and legal issues.
- **Operational Risks**: Risks from model underperformance due to data drift, pipeline failures, or corrupted data, impacting business operations, revenue, and organizational reputation.

## Why Robust Intelligence Tests AI Models

Robust Intelligence integrates risk testing into the entire AI lifecycle, ensuring continuous oversight for security, ethical, and operational integrity.

### Key Testing Phases

1. **Stress Testing**: Measures the robustness of your AI model before deployment, identifying potential weaknesses and failure modes. 
2. **Continuous Testing**: Monitors models in production, detecting vulnerabilities like data drift or adversarial attacks in real-time.

### How Risk Testing Works in the AI Pipeline

- **Model Development**: During development, AI Stress Testing runs pre-configured tests to assess the model's robustness against potential production risks.
- **Production**: Continuous Testing monitors deployed models, alerting to issues such as data drift, adversarial attacks, and evolving vulnerabilities.

## Key Features

### AI Stress Testing
- A comprehensive testing suite that identifies weaknesses and vulnerabilities in AI models before deployment. Stress tests include a range of scenarios, from simple operational risk tests to complex security challenges, providing insights to improve model robustness.

### AI Continuous Testing
- Continuous monitoring of AI models in production, alerting to emerging vulnerabilities or failures like data drift and adversarial threats. Continuous tests can be configured to run on a fixed schedule and provide regular insights.

### AI Validation
- Automatically evaluates AI models, data, and files to assess vulnerabilities and establishes guardrails for secure deployment.

### AI Protection
- Uses automated updates from a threat intelligence platform to protect AI applications from integrity, privacy, abuse, and availability threats.

## Core Capabilities of Robust Intelligence

Robust Intelligence offers testing across multiple machine learning task categories, including:

- **Tabular Data**: Binary classification, multiclass classification, regression, and learning to rank.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Text classification, named entity recognition, natural language inference, and fill-mask modeling.
- **Computer Vision (CV)**: Image classification and object detection.

## Measuring AI Risk

Modern AI models require robust performance metrics beyond traditional testing. By evaluating models in real-world contexts, Robust Intelligence enables continuous testing and stress testing to detect risks across three categories:

1. **Security**: Protects against exploitation and adversarial threats.
2. **Ethics**: Ensures compliance with ethical standards to avoid bias and regulatory issues.
3. **Operations**: Detects and mitigates performance degradation and data drift.

## Inputs for Testing

Robust Intelligence requires the following inputs to run Stress Tests (ST) and Continuous Tests (CT):

1. **Data**:
   - **Stress Testing**: Requires a reference dataset (clean training data) and an evaluation dataset (production-ready data), optionally with labels and model predictions.
   - **Continuous Testing**: Includes regular production evaluation data to monitor ongoing model performance.

2. **Model**: Access to the model via a `model.py` file that includes a prediction function. This file, registered in the Robust Intelligence Model Registry, enables Robust Intelligence to test model behavior under various scenarios.

## AI Compliance Management - Model Cards

The platform supports AI compliance management by providing downloadable, auto-generated model cards for documentation, incorporating Stress and Continuous Testing results. These reports help organizations comply with AI regulatory standards and maintain a record of testing.

## Workspace Overview

Robust Intelligenceâ€™s workspace provides visibility into all models in production, allowing organizations to track model health and align AI security across stakeholders, which is particularly valuable for AI leadership.

## Benefits of Using Robust Intelligence

Robust Intelligence helps organizations:

- Remove AI security blockers.
- Deploy applications quickly.
- Decouple AI development from AI security.
- Align AI security across stakeholders.
- Meet industry standards for AI safety and security.
- Improve algorithm robustness and scalability.
