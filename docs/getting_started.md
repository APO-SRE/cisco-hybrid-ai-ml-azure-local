# Getting Started Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to help you set up the foundational infrastructure for the **Cisco AI-Driven Enterprise Data Architecture** on Azure Local with Cisco UCS. It focuses on:

- Deploying Azure Local on Cisco UCS hardware.
- Setting up Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) on Azure Local.
- Configuring Azure and Cisco resources required for the solution.

For detailed deployment of AI/ML workloads and Generative AI applications, please refer to the specific deployment guides listed in the [Next Steps](#next-steps) section.

### 3. Set Up AKS on Azure Local

Deploy Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) on Azure Local to run containerized workloads.

- **Deployment Guide**: [AKS on Azure Local Deployment Guide](/deployment/aks_deployment_guide.md)

**High-Level Steps**:

1. **Install AKS on Azure Local**:
   - Use PowerShell or Windows Admin Center to install AKS on your cluster.

2. **Configure Kubernetes Cluster**:
   - Create a Kubernetes cluster using AKS on Azure Local.
   - Configure node pools and networking settings.

3. **Validate the Deployment**:
   - Ensure that the Kubernetes cluster is up and running.
   - Use `kubectl` to interact with the cluster.

# Summary

In this updated `getting_started.md`, the focus is on setting up the foundational infrastructure, including:

- **Deployment of Azure Local on Cisco UCS hardware**.
- **Setup of AKS on Azure Local**.
- **Configuration of Cisco networking and security products**.
- **Setup of Azure resources, including the Azure Machine Learning workspace and Azure Arc integration**.

The guide provides high-level steps and points users to the specific deployment guides for detailed instructions. It refrains from diving into the deployment of AI/ML workloads or Generative AI applications, which are covered in the subsequent sections listed under [Next Steps](#next-steps).

This approach ensures that users can set up the necessary infrastructure and resources before proceeding to deploy specific workloads, aligning with your request.
