#### 2. Machine Learning Driven Data Flow
This flow involves collecting telemetry data from various devices through gRPC using Telegraf or other ingestion options. The data is processed using AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service) Machine Learning models deployed on Cisco UCS hardware with Azure Local or connected directly to Azure AKS. This enables advanced analytics, predictive maintenance, and intelligent decision-making, with the results visualized in Splunk.
