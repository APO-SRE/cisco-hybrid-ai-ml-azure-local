# Cisco Hypershield

Cisco Hypershield is a cutting-edge security product designed to provide robust, cloud-native, and highly distributed security for AI-scale data centers. It leverages AI-powered capabilities to implement autonomous and easy-to-manage security policies, making it ideal for modern, data-intensive environments.

## Key Features

- **Security Posture Assessment**: Evaluates defenses against known attack techniques, ensuring that security measures are up to date and resilient to threats.
  
- **Red Team/Blue Team Exercises**: Structures and evaluates security testing and incident response exercises, helping organizations improve their incident readiness.

- **Kernel Access Minimization**: Reduces direct interactions with the Windows kernel to avoid vulnerabilities, enhancing system stability and security.

- **eBPF Technology**: Uses Extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) technology for safer kernel interactions, enabling efficient and secure data processing without compromising system performance.

- **Self-Qualifying Updates**: Tests changes in live production environments before enacting them to minimize risk, ensuring updates do not introduce new vulnerabilities.

- **Gradual Rollout Capabilities**: Supports canary deployments and rolling updates to manage potential risks, allowing for controlled implementation of updates across the system.

- **Continuous Validation**: An AI-driven system monitors for anomalies and potential issues, providing proactive security and reducing the window for exploitations.

- **Modular Design**: Allows for rapid isolation and remediation of issues without compromising overall security, ensuring that vulnerabilities can be contained effectively.

- **Autonomous Segmentation**: Uses a dynamic and intelligent segmentation model to reduce time and complexity in application segmentation, optimizing network security configurations.

- **Centralized Security Policy Management**: Implements a centralized, intent-based policy model that is easy to manage and scales across multiple domains, simplifying policy management for large organizations.

## Additional Features

- **Integration with MITRE ATT&CK Framework**: Hypershield integrates with the MITRE ATT&CK framework for vulnerability detection and distributed exploit protection, enhancing its ability to detect and respond to potential threats effectively.

- **Tesseract Security Agent (TSA)**: The TSA is a high-performance monitoring and anomaly detection agent used in both Kubernetes and non-Kubernetes environments, providing real-time visibility and control over application security.

## Benefits

Cisco Hypershield is specifically built for security use cases in AI-scale data centers. By combining innovative technologies like eBPF and AI-driven continuous validation, it provides a comprehensive security solution that is resilient, adaptable, and scalable. Its modular design and centralized management make it easy to deploy, manage, and update across large and complex environments.
